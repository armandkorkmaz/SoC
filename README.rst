Toy project for universiy
=========================

This is just a (yet) unfinished project for university using the SoC. The idea
is to write a BW filter in verilog, C+HLS and C (running in the ARM), use the
AXI4-Stream for fast access and compare the time.

The manually written Verilog does clever tricks to divide by 3 using just
shifts (mathematically correct :))


As the IDEs sucks, this was created on my ~/co-diseno/tp-final/soc/...
